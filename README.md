# Clash-of-Particles

This project was realized for my an IT class at ISAE-SUPAERO in 2017.
It is written in C on a Linux machine.
Before compiling or executing, make sure you have SDL2.

For a simple execution: open a terminal, go into the repository and write ./clash-of-particles.
The machine will ask you whether to enable Newton. If you say Yes, you will see a Newton pendulum with a few particles.
If you say No, you will then be asked how many particles you want to include in you simulation. Write a number (200 for instance), press enter and see them bounce all over the place!
The simulation will end after a few minutes.
